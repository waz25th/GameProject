# GameProject

this project is a simple guessing game in which the user will guess a number between 1 and 100 (or 1000 depending on whether it is guessNumber.java or guessingGame.java ), if correct, the game closes. 
If they are wrong, they are prompted to try again until the right number is entered.

the guessingGame.java file is the final code after playing around with the guessNumber. java file
in guessNumber.java i tried to use java.util.scanner instead of JOptionPane, the latter is more interactive and played a big part in deciding which method to go with in the end


This is my first project, so i made use of some videos and forums to help me create this project as i am still learning the Java language.
