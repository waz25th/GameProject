# GameProject

this project is a simple guessing game in which the user will guess a number between 1 and 100, if correct, the game closes. 
If they are wrong, they are prompted to try again until the right number is entered.

This is my first project, so i made use of some videos and forums to help me create this project as i am still learning the Java language.
